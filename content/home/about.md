# Biograph

I am Professor of Computer Science at IMT Lille Douai and CRIStAL (UMR CNRS 9189). I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Lille 1 in 1993 and Habilitation Ã  Diriger des Recherches from the University of Littoral in 2000.  My research interests include pattern recognition, computer vision, machine learning, biometrics, three-dimensional (3D) shape analysis and related applications (3D face recognition, 3D facial expression recognition, 3D retrieval). I am Fellow of IAPR, senior member IEEE and ACM member.
